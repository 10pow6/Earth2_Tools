Next generation E2 Tools :). This is just the beginning. 

Backend calls to E2 are pretty quick. The code for writing to the local database currently SUCKS (just throwing it together for functionality).  This will be heavily optimized later, but expect some longer processing times on the manage page.

**Roadmap:**
1. Basic functionality hopefully by EOM Jan
2. Focus on UI elements after
3. Refactor code/performance improvmenets
4. More visualizations and features
